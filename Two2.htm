                          The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming
                          it.” - Moliere. While this may be true, can the
                          obstacle truly be overcomed? Is it even our choice?
                          John Steinbeck's’ Of Mice and Men explores many such
                          questions. The narrative follows Lennie and George,
                          two friends finding work in a ranch. They’re saving up
                          money to buy their own farm, and along the way they
                          have interactions with different characters. Most of
                          the main characters are disadvantaged and nearly all
                          of them have an American dream. The story follows what
                          happened with their American dream and how they deal
                          with their lives in the ranch. Many people have
                          certain limitations, and they attempt to overcome the
                          obstacle caused by it, but fate would not allow their
                          endeavors to prevail. <br>
                          <br>
                          Many people have their own limitations. Three
                          characters in particular are restricted in their own
                          unique way; Curley’s wife, Candy, and Crooks. With
                          Curley’s wife she’s first described as having “full,
                          rouged lips and wide-spaced eyes, heavily made
                          up”(Steinbeck 31) along with other descriptions about
                          her appearance. There is nothing said about her
                          character and even her name is unknown to the reader.
                          This imagery of the only woman in the ranch is
                          stereotypically pretty, hinting at the typical woman a
                          man wants, with no regards to her personality. This
                          objectification makes it so that a woman’s looks are
                          her only power and, in the book, all they did was lead
                          her to trouble. Candy’s trouble is his crippling age,
                          and he’s disabled with only one hand. He obviously
                          doesn’t have the strength of the other workers. This
                          makes him weak and the ranch is a place where there is
                          no place for the weak. When Candy is shown to “stare
                          at the ceiling” (Steinbeck 49) he’s been deeply
                          affected by the death of his dog. His dog was put to
                          death because it was old and no longer had any
                          usefulness. The dog symbolizes weakness. Its age makes
                          it so that it can’t be compared to anything young.
                          It’s blind, and thus it is constantly dependent on its
                          owner. Weakness is also what isolates Curley’s wife.
                          Being a woman, she is treated with condescension, it
                          is not accepted for her to talk with anyone else
                          besides Curley. If one can no longer serve a purpose,
                          he or she will be removed, with no consideration to
                          his or her situation. Nobody considers Crook’s
                          situation either. He’s more secluded from the ranch
                          workers than anybody else, since his race prevents him
                          from interacting from everyone else. His crooked back
                          is one of his weaknesses and he has “had more
                          possessions than he could carry on his back”
                          (Steinbeck 67). His possessions are all he has that
                          make him happy. His back is a symbol of oppression,
                          and in this case, it stems from racism. He is
                          constantly bent forward when facing white people since
                          they rule over him. This oppression is what compelled
                          Candy to allow his innocent dog to be put down. People
                          are helpless against oppression because they have no
                          chance of defending themselves, and their lack of
                          choice is what causes their downfall <br>
                          <br>
                          Loneliness has been the biggest obstacle that has
                          limited a person. Crooks isn’t the only one who is
                          lonely. Everyone refuses to talk to Curley’s wife and
                          without his dog Candy doesn’t have anyone. Loneliness
                          was an effect of their constrictions. The characters
                          attempted to overcome this loneliness by talking to
                          Lennie. When Curley’s wife’s “words tumbled out in a
                          passion of communication” (Steinbeck 88) she
                          exemplified her desperation to talk to someone. The
                          words are personified as tumbling because they escape
                          her mouth suddenly, as it wasn’t supposed to happen.
                          She’s isolated because she’s the only female in a
                          ranch on men, but this proves how she’s actually just
                          like everyone else. She’s also someone who couldn’t
                          achieve her American dream. The characters were
                          supposed to cure their loneliness because fate would
                          interfere with their lives. Candy has been fate’s toy
                          for years. Candy couldn’t achieve his longing for
                          peace in in old life. He talked to Lennie so that he
                          could stay at their ranch with them and live out his
                          last days in peace. Otherwise he will suffer a worse
                          fate, as he says “I wisht somebody'd shoot me. But
                          they won't do nothing like that” (Steinbeck 60) if
                          they ever let him go. A man is preferring death over
                          spending more time at the ranch because most of the
                          characters want a content life. Though, this better
                          life can never be achieved, because fate won’t accept
                          it. Crooks also wants peace. He’s accepted his social
                          stereotype as an African American and seems to feel
                          disdain when white people come near him. He ends up
                          isolating himself even more, but he submits himself to
                          “Lennie’s disarming smile” (Steinbeck 69). It’s ironic
                          that he would be so welcoming towards Lennie when he
                          has just told him to go away, meaning that he actually
                          appreciates the company. Like many characters, he
                          submits to Lennie’s smile because that’s the only way
                          fill that empty void in his life. By interacting with
                          those who are accepting of someone can that person’s
                          unhappiness be relieved, but the world does not have
                          many people who are this accepting. <br>
                          <br>
                          Even though there were attempt obstacles, that was
                          never achievable. Crooks finally found someone to
                          confide in, but that ended rapidly. He was pulled back
                          to reality, where he realized he could never be with
                          Lennie and George. When he “looked at the door”
                          (Steinbeck 83) after Candy, George, and Lennie has
                          left he was looking at a symbol of a boundary that he
                          could never cross uninvited. The other characters were
                          had more freedom because they were still thought of as
                          people. Crooks is not a slave, but he is as much of a
                          possession as his books. A limitation can make a man
                          worth the same as an old dictionary. The dreams in
                          this book are also worth this much. “Looked down at
                          the hay” (Steinbeck 94) before letting George answer
                          because he knew the truth. There was no way they were
                          ever going to buy that ranch. That dream was a symbol
                          of temptation. There wasn’t a character who achieved
                          his American dream, because it’s unachievable. Yet,
                          people constantly fall for its trap believing that
                          their wishes can become a reality, but their
                          disadvantages would keep their wishes from coming
                          true. Curley’s wife wished to be in the movies but
                          being a female, she was deceived into believing this.
                          This forced her to marry Curley for financial reasons.
                          The horses “rattled the halter chains” (Steinbeck 98)
                          when she died because it foreshadowed the unavoidable
                          danger. The loud rattling occurs whenever she was
                          around, for it was a warning of what fate had in store
                          for them. Fate is what decides one’s path in life, not
                          one’s dreams. <br>
                          <br>
                          Though people attempts to overcome the obstacles that
                          stem from their limitations, their endeavors are never
                          authorized by fate. Jamal Penjweny is a photographer
                          who showed many people in Iraq holding a picture of
                          their favorite athlete. Each of these Iraqis were
                          people with a dream, but due to poverty or physical
                          injury they could not become the famous stars they
                          though they were going to be. They didn't decide to be
                          born poor or get life-changing injuries. Fate was the
                          one who made disadvantaged. <br>
