                          <br>
                          In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a serious question
                          has arisen for American citizens. Is sacrificing
                          freedom in the name of security worth the cost? There
                          are reasons to support both sides of this argument.
                          After all, people generally do not enjoy living
                          restrained, but what is the point of living freely if
                          those people are living insecurely? When that question
                          comes to mind, it is logical to think that security
                          measures are far more important. The individuals who
                          are solely focused on freedom fail to realize the
                          consequences of not sacrificing part of these
                          freedoms. They believe that their complete freedom is
                          more important than the safety of children, families,
                          and this great nation. This makes the answer to the
                          question abundantly clear. Yes, it is worth it to
                          sacrifice freedom for security measures, until
                          protection is guaranteed. <br>
                          <br>
                          It makes perfect sense for American citizens to be
                          suspicious of virtually unfettered government
                          surveillance. The government has not done its job to
                          provide reasonable explanations about how it uses the
                          data of its citizens. They question whether or not the
                          Patriot Act is actually constitutional. It was created
                          after the 9/11 attacks to prevent terrorism. It
                          allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to
                          not only receive the phone data of potential
                          terrorists, but also the data of any individual
                          considered relevant to an investigation. The
                          government has been extremely secretive about their
                          possibly unconstitutional surveillance, and at first
                          glance, it does seem to risk the right to privacy, a
                          deeply cherished American freedom. The government's
                          data-mining has been on what they call suspicious
                          activity. This includes seemingly innocent things such
                          as photography and note taking in certain areas. Most
                          importantly, some United States citizens feel that
                          they they are not seeing the government bring results
                          from sacrificing their freedoms, but rather it is just
                          excuses its actions for national security reasons.
                          Admittedly, the government was able to look up the
                          data for any individual in the nation for possible
                          terrorist activity. However, President Barack Obama
                          has ended the FBI'S free access to phone records. The
                          records will stay with the phone companies and can
                          only be accessed with permission from a federal court.
                          Also, there has been proof that confirms government
                          surveillance has been beneficial. Post 9/11 the
                          national security has helped stop at least 30
                          potential terrorist attacks on United States soil, by
                          conducting legitimate surveillance. Despite all the
                          complaints about the Patriot Act being
                          unconstitutional, there has been little evidence to
                          support these claims. As a matter of fact, there have
                          been continuous movements that make sure government
                          surveillance under the Patriot Act is indeed
                          constitutional. <br>
                          <br>
                          The United States is heavily focused on its freedom,
                          inasmuch that it does not know how to guarantee safety
                          alongside. It cannot uphold its first amendment, which
                          states that Congress cannot pass a law that respects a
                          religion, or pass a law that prohibits the free
                          exercise of religion. The Mississippi HB2 law
                          prohibits local governments from protecting the LGBT
                          community against discrimination, for religious
                          opposition reasons. While the law supports the free
                          exercise right, it is still a law that respects
                          certain religions. Had the state of Mississippi been
                          willing to sacrifice part of this freedom, the
                          innocent LGBT community would have been better
                          protected. "It should be permissible, I'd argue, for
                          an individual or a faith-based organization to seek a
                          personal exemption from a law that would otherwise
                          threaten their religious identity. It should not,
                          however, be permissible for the same individual or
                          group to project that identity onto others by writing
                          their religious beliefs into the law itself." If
                          religion or other factors become part of the law,
                          there would be no point in having one. It could never
                          guarantee the safety of the nation's citizens. The
                          animals are like citizens of Animal Farm, who want
                          freedom and safety. When the hens "protested that to
                          take the eggs away now was murder", Napoleon proved
                          that the could not provide the animals safety or
                          freedom. His actions displayed that he would even go
                          against their strongest principles, and become like
                          man, before helping the animals. A promise for
                          security had been broken, and the officials gave their
                          attention to gaining more power, instead of finding a
                          proper solution. If one cannot guarantee safety, that
                          person cannot guarantee freedom either. <br>
                          <br>
                          The ones in power cannot lose sight of the purpose of
                          freedom, otherwise it will lead to great downfall.
                          When Karl Marx created communism it was meant to be
                          the solution to inequality. It sounds excellent in
                          theory, but it is also unrealistic. One's desire for
                          power would make them lose sight of what they are
                          standing for. The irony in "ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT
                          SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS" proves this.
                          It does not make sense for things to be equal while
                          some things are more equal than them. Napoleon's
                          desire for power caused the great rebellion to fail.
                          He completely disregarded the goal of the rebellion,
                          and became worse than man, twisting Animal Farm and
                          the Seven Commandments into something they were never
                          meant to be. The Seven Commandments were principles to
                          be lived by everyday. The pigs lost focus of the
                          commandments and put more attention to gaining power.
                          They instead manipulated the animals into believing
                          they needed all the power to protect them and thus
                          changed the rules. "No animal shall sleep in a bed
                          with sheets", "No animal shall kill any other animal
                          without cause", and "No animal shall drink alcohol to
                          excess," are ways the pigs abused the animal's trust
                          and became more like man, and the pigs provided ironic
                          reasoning for these changes. An intensely debated
                          freedom in the United States is the freedom of speech.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          What many people forget to realize is that freedom of
                          speech also applies to hate speech. While the Unite
                          the Right rally in Charlottesville was allowed to
                          express their intense feeling, they officials should
                          have interfered before the violence started. "Local
                          officials must rise to the challenge and ensure the
                          public peace through proper preparation, crowd
                          control, site-specific rules on what items are
                          allowed, and other reasonable steps to mitigate
                          violence." Instead, officials delayed the action to
                          uphold the freedom of speech, resulting in the loss of
                          3 innocent lives, and 38 more casualties. There will
                          be more casualties unless freedom is sacrificed. Even
                          the commandments were actually made to be security
                          measures but by refusing to sacrifice a little bit for
                          these rules, they became pointless. Airport security
                          checks were created to prevent potential terrorist
                          attacks like 9/11, but what they failed to realize is
                          that the terrorists "were not exploiting a weakness in
                          luggage screening, but rather a weakness in our
                          mind-set, our understanding and expectations of what a
                          hijacking was and how it would unfold." The TSA has
                          the right to check luggage and prevent people from
                          going forward, but it cannot invade one's rights in
                          any way. People will continue to abuse power and
                          invade rights if freedom is not sacrificed for
                          security. <br>
