                          <br>
                          My introduction to basic income best comes through an
                          explanation of my culture. I am a U.S. resident on the
                          path to become a citizen. Currently, I still hold an
                          Indian passport. Therefore, I believe that I should
                          still keep up with the news of my parent's motherland.
                          So, I was reading an article on The Times of India
                          (basically the Indian equivalent of the New York
                          Times) and I discovered an article talking about
                          Andrew Yang and his policy on basic income. This was
                          surprising to me for a few reasons. Why would an
                          Indian news outlet write a paper about Andrew Yang?
                          Andrew Yang certainly has his followers as proven by
                          the fact that he is one of the mere ten Democratic
                          candidates to qualify for the September 2019 debate,
                          but he isn't being considered as a frontrunner at the
                          moment. It was my second question that really peaked
                          my interest in this discussion. Why is basic income
                          becoming such an international topic? As far as I knew
                          basic income was a method of making sure every citizen
                          would receive payment of the government without any
                          factors holding that person from receiving his
                          payment. I'm not sure how is that even possible.
                          America has the largest economy in the world at around
                          20 trillion - China's in second place at around 12
                          trillion - but does the government have enough money
                          to give its pay its citizens a basic income? That's
                          just my concern for the United States. Clearly basic
                          income is a global topic, so how would other countries
                          manage this monetary situation. How would this basic
                          income affect normal earning methods. Would this mean
                          that through basic income, someone who's unemployed
                          would still make enough money to provide for himself.
                          Wouldn't that just make people lazier? This led me to
                          the overarching question that I wished to answer: How
                          would basic income effect the American way of life?
                          The first step was to properly define what basic
                          income is. Luckily there was an official website
                          called basicincome.org which would detail information
                          regarding basic income. In that website basic income
                          was defined as, "a periodic cash payment
                          unconditionally delivered to all on an individual
                          basis, without means-test or work requirement" (Basic
                          Income). The website lays out two types of basic
                          income. Full basic income is "a policy strategy to
                          eliminate material poverty and enable the social and
                          cultural participation of every individual" (Basic
                          Income), while a partial basic income is a lower one.
                          The organization concedes to the fact that they have
                          not attempted to define what monetary payment
                          qualifies as full or partial. Supporters of basic
                          income vouch for this idea for two reasons: social
                          policy and economic policy. Supporters claim the
                          governments of the world cannot operate the two
                          policies separately; basic income may be the solution
                          to poverty relief and full employment. <br>
                          <br>
                          Surely with basic income being such a global topic
                          there must have been some place that already
                          implemented it. That question led me to a podcast by
                          NPR, a media organization established by Congress. The
                          podcast mainly went over the basic income experiment
                          in Finland. I am not an economist but to put it in the
                          simplest of words: the welfare system in Finland is
                          not favorable. Therefore a group of people in
                          association with the Finnish government have created
                          an experiment where 2000 unemployed Finnish citizens
                          were randomly selected (did not volunteer) and were
                          mailed 560 euros a month. There won't be an official
                          analyzation of the experiment for another few years
                          since the experiment is so new. However from the
                          responses from those were experimented on were fairly
                          positive. Basic income allowed them to have enough
                          money until they could find another job. Despite the
                          boatload of information in this podcast the experiment
                          took place in Finland, which has different policies
                          from the United States, and it only provided money for
                          those who are unemployed. The basic income plan
                          proposed in the United States would pay all citizens.
                          This podcast highlighted another angle to basic income
                          which has only recently began to be associated with
                          economic discussion: robots. People have been
                          increasingly clamoring at the idea, which is slowly
                          becoming a fact, that robots will begin to overtake
                          many jobs. Mark Zuckerberg framed the policy of basic
                          income as "a cushion to try new ideas" for the
                          exponential possibility that artificial intelligence
                          and automation will take over a multitude of
                          middle-class jobs. <br>
                          <br>
                          Before tackling the artificial intelligence angle, the
                          next piece of research on how UBI would affect human
                          society was through a political filter. How do
                          politicians differ on this topic? Surprisingly, there
                          wasn't a clear divide on which side supported UBI and
                          which did not. Many republicans as well as prominent
                          democrats have supported UBI. According to the news
                          article by CNBC, most of the divide between American
                          who support basic income and those who don't has to do
                          with the "debate as to whether robots will actually
                          take people's jobs" (Clifford). After discovering two
                          different types of sources both discussing artificial
                          intelligence I decided to explore further research on
                          that angle. The magazine article by the New Yorker
                          claims that "if you job can be explained, it will be
                          automated" (Lepore). Therefore there will be three
                          class division in the near future. The elite who have
                          adapted to this technology, the humans who provide
                          services directly to the elite, and the unemployed
                          victims of automation, also referred to as the
                          "useless class" (Lepore), who will need basic income
                          in order to compensate. Despite the strong stance, the
                          article later admitted that people have "people have
                          consistently adjusted to advancing economies"
                          (Lepore). <br>
                          <br>
                          So there are many answers for why basic income is
                          required to save workers, but wouldn't basic income
                          just discourage people from finding other jobs if they
                          were already given money to survive by? The question
                          presented me with Scott Santen's blog. Santen has
                          written for many well-known publications and has been
                          on news programs as an expert on basic income. He
                          approaches the question in an interesting way. His
                          main argument revolves around the fact that "we are
                          one open society" (Santen). Those who work for
                          themselves believe that people will stop working if
                          they are given basic income. However, the American
                          system works in such a way that you normally end up
                          working for someone else. As long as the amount of
                          basic income provided is not some outrageous amount,
                          people will naturally have to come to work for someone
                          else. Unfortunately that wasn't very clear so an
                          article by Adi Gaskell on Forbes gives an example of
                          Basic Income already present in the United States.
                          Alaska provides people with $2000 per year. This has
                          no effect on full time employment and actually was
                          found to raise part time employment by 17%. Like the
                          Finland experiment, the data has not been properly
                          analyzed so the meaning behind this isn't clear, but
                          it is an indication that basic income will not change
                          our way of life. So far all the information about
                          basic income leaned too much on its positives. In a
                          way that's good because it outlines that most people
                          believe it is a promising idea that is worth
                          implementing. On the other hand the negatives must
                          also be weighed in. An essay by Robert Rector and Mimi
                          Teixeira provides examples of past experiments to
                          highlight the downside of basic income. For them the
                          main issue is that basic income will increase the
                          scope of the government. This expansion would power
                          may lead to a dependence on the government for
                          individuals who should be able to provide for
                          themselves. Since basic income does not discriminate
                          against any individual, it blurs the line between all
                          sorts of people To connect with the other sources,
                          despite the threat of artificial intelligence adopting
                          basic income would decrease social aid for those who
                          have a legitimate problem and cannot support
                          themselves. <br>
                          <br>
                          Throughout the research a common statement was rolled
                          around: not enough data. There has not been any
                          examples with significant observations and data
                          collections of basic income for anybody to conclude
                          how basic income will surely change the way of life.
                          An artificial intelligence revolution is an almost
                          guarantee, but there are many aspects through which
                          one can approach this reality. A similar situation
                          occurred during the industrial revolution which led to
                          "unprecedented economic and social disorder" (Lepore).
                          Despite this policy makers should not ignore that
                          technological growth in the current 21st century is
                          exponential, especially when compared to the growth of
                          the industrial revolution which has been categorized
                          as linear growth. There is more room for damage.
                          However, there are too many variables to suddenly
                          begin a wide scale basic income program. Economic as
                          social factors such as "hyperinflation and wealth
                          inequality" (Santens) will always be at play.
                          Furthermore, the topic is quite new in mainstream
                          politics, so not enough people even understand it
                          enough to even formulate an opinion on it. <br>
                          <br>
                          If I were to pick a course of action the U.S.
                          government would find a way to gather enough money to
                          pay American citizens without causing inflation. Then
                          there needs to be strict guidelines upheld in order to
