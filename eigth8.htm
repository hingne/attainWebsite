                          <br>
                          In George Orwell’s "Shooting an Elephant", imperialism
                          is a system of power that, from the perspective of
                          those carrying it out and those upon whom it is
                          enacted, is unnecessary and unwanted. The essay
                          deconstructs Orwell’s experiences and perceptions of
                          the British Empire. His extended metaphor combined
                          with his vivid imagery draws attention to his
                          helplessness as a government representative, and as a
                          human being, in order to prove his argument that
                          imperialism is evil.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          In Orwell’s discussion of the Burmese people, he
                          establishes the initial complicated situation
                          regarding interaction between Europeans and natives in
                          the first two paragraphs. The British are there to
                          rule over another country, and expect the Burmese to
                          accept their predicament. Though Orwell doesn't
                          support the British Empire, he is still an officer. He
                          is annoyed at the "Bhuddist priests" that "jeer at
                          Europeans;" he feels guilt at watching "prisoners
                          huddling in the stinking cages of the lockups, the
                          grey, cowed faces of the long-term convicts, the
                          scarred buttocks of the men who had been Bogged with
                          bamboos." This is a result of imperialism. As a human
                          being, Orwell struggles with doing his duty and
                          accepting such agonizing mistreatment of individuals
                          who are punished because they cannot adhere to
                          cultural expectations that aren’t their own. Orwell
                          understands the oppression of the Burmese, and
                          personally seems to tolerate their actions. <br>
                          <br>
                          In revealing the tensions he experiences, as well as
                          the conflicts inherent to imperialism, Orwell deploys
                          a narrative of an elephant in "must" as an extended
                          metaphor for the British Empire. The elephant has had
                          a fit and has been attacking a certain part of town,
                          including killing one of the Burmese. However, the
                          Burmese have no weapons to defend themselves. As a
                          metaphor, the elephant is clearly the British who have
                          been oppressing the powerless Burmese. Orwell
                          describes one of the victims: "His face was coated
                          with mud, the eyes wide open, teeth bared and grinning
                          with an expression of unendurable agony." This vivid
                          imagery depicts the suffering of native peoples at the
                          hand of the British empire as much as it conveys what
                          happened when the man was trampled by the elephant.
                          Thus all the more weight is added to Orwell’s
                          obligation to do something about the elephant. <br>
                          <br>
                          It is imperial policy that an elephant that has killed
                          someone must be shot. Moreover, it is expected by the
                          Burmese themselves. Orwell comments how "they had not
                          shown much interest in the elephant when he was merely
                          ravaging their homes, but it was different now that he
                          was going to be shot." Orwell is reluctant to shoot
                          the elephant, particularly because by the time he’s
                          acquired the necessary gun and located the elephant it
                          is no longer in must. When Orwell finds the animal, he
                          presumes it "would merely wander harmlessly about
                          until the mahout came back and caught him." There is
                          therefore no pressing need to shoot the elephant other
                          than official imperial policy mandating it must be
                          done. The elephant as an extended metaphor indicates
                          that Orwell felt the British Empire had also survived
                          its recent fit and was returning once more to calm.
                          Nonetheless, within the narrative itself, Orwell, as
                          an officer holding an elephant gun, is forced by
                          public perception to use that gun on an elephant that
                          is no longer a menace to society. Orwell’s position is
                          one of a reluctant individual who does not want to do
                          what he is being made to do by both the empire and the
                          Burmese. As Orwell reminds the reader, "if anything
                          went wrong those two thousand Burmans would see [him]
                          pursued, caught, trampled on and reduced to a grinning
                          corpse like that Indian up the hill." Orwell is
                          therefore stuck between what the empire would do to
                          him and what the imperialized would do to him. Orwell
                          therefore takes aim and shoots the elephant, wounding
                          but not killing the animal before commenting that "it
                          seemed dreadful to see the great beast lying there,
                          powerless to move and yet powerless to die, and not
                          even to be able to finish him." The killing was
                          bloody, agonizing and unnecessary. It was caused by
                          Orwell’s context, of being where he wasn’t needed and
                          being forced to take actions that weren’t required
                          because displays of force were requisite to the
                          maintenance of British power. But like the elephant
                          itself, the British empire was exposed to the
                          potential, lingering violence of the native peoples
                          who could, at any time, overwhelm and destroy it. <br>
                          <br>
                          The disturbing shooting of the elephant draws
                          attention to the violence inherent to imperialism, to
                          the restrictions placed on imperial officers and to
                          the oppression that is forced on imperialized peoples.
                          It is Orwell’s use of extended metaphor and imagery
                          that allow his essay to make a wider point about his
                          experience: that the elephant is not just a single
                          animal in Burma but a representation of the British
                          empire itself. The empire has trampled over people, it
                          has wounded and killed, and it will be put down as a
                          result. But unlike in the essay, where it is Orwell, a
                          British officer, who extends the violence, it is clear
                          that the British elephant will not be euthanized in
                          quite the same manner. If the Burmese rise up to
                          overthrow the British empire there will be more
                          violence than what Orwell has conveyed in his essay. <br>
