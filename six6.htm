                          Most of us have some idea of what we want to be in
                          life. This includes our occupations, and what kind of
                          people we desire to be. Someone who has grown up being
                          the star child would probably want to be a leader of
                          others. Someone who loves to learn new facts, and
                          explores new talents may want to be at a place where
                          he is open to express new discoveries.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Whatever place we desire to end up, we view it as a
                          form of paradise or the ultimate success story. The
                          leader can lead his team to great success, but if his
                          team members turn on him, he will lose his own life
                          force. The man who always desires to explore may
                          receive short term success but could fall in a
                          situation where he realizes there is no practical way
                          of maintaining his garden of freedom.

                          While these are dramatic examples, they are not
                          necessarily false. What these people did wrong is that
                          they merely identified where their version of paradise
                          exists. Success is not achieved when we realize where
                          it exists, but when we realize what it means to us,
                          and how do we get there.

                          The "Treachery of Images" by Magritte is a painting of
                          a pipe. Though the artist himself wrote in the
                          painting it is not a pipe. The piece is not trying to
                          provoke doubt from the audience, but elicit different
                          pathways of thought. Two people may look at The
                          Treachery of Images and conclude that it's simply a
                          painting of a pipe. How they interpret the piece and
                          how they arrive at that interpretation will be
                          different.

                          It is almost an impossibility for any two individuals
                          to think alike. If two kids grow up liking sports,
                          only one of them may become an athlete. That does not
                          mean the other child cannot be in the same field. That
                          other child could grow up to specialize in sports
                          medicine. They both started with the same interests
                          but took the path that would make them happy.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          It is a reasonable statement to say that the path you
                          take will be influenced by what you define as success.
                          Hosseini's The Kite Runner is known for giving us a
                          simple, yet epic tale about a boy from Afghanistan.
                          The novel also succeeds in allowing the reader to
                          appreciate those around them.

                          <br>
                          The once affluent main character, Amir, thought that
                          his life was always going to relatively facile. Even
                          when he moved to the United States, Amir was happy on
                          the surface because he knew where he was going to end
                          up, but he didn't know how he would end up. The debris
                          from the guilt that Amir caught from his time in
                          Afghanistan, struck the readers as well.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          The ending of the narrative was fulling because the
                          whole time its goal was to bring happiness to the main
                          character's family. The narrative proved that the
                          definition of success changed as one realizes what he
                          really wants.

                          When most people watch the original Star Wars film,
                          they felt a connection with the character Han Solo.
                          This is because, in the beginning, Han Solo's
                          signature quality resonates with many people's own
                          experiences. Han is not a "chosen one". He knows where
                          he will end up and has accepted this fact. He
                          character arc is powerful because he learns what
                          helping the Resistance means, and how he can help.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Likewise, we are given a multitude of opportunities to
                          prevent falling into the same pit of desolation that
                          Han Solo was in before meeting Skywalker. It is our
                          responsibility to snatch these opportunities with our
                          very jaws if we need to.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Utilizing these teachings, we can bring greater
                          enlightenment to ourselves and help those around us.
                          Recognizing what success means for us, and how we can
                          reach there, can make our society stronger as well.
