                                  obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it.” -
                                  Moliere. While this may be true, can the
                                  obstacle truly be overcomed? Is it even our
                                  choice? John Steinbeck's’ Of Mice and Men
                                  explores many such questions. The narrative
                                  follows Lennie and George, two friends finding
                                  work in a ranch. They’re saving up money to
                                  buy their own farm, and along the way they
                                  have interactions with different characters.
                                  Most of the main characters are disadvantaged
                                  and nearly all of them have an American dream.
                                  The story follows what happened with their
                                  American dream and how they deal with their
                                  lives in the ranch. Many people have certain
                                  limitations, and they attempt to overcome the
                                  obstacle caused by it, but fate would not
                                  allow their endeavors to prevail.<br>
                                  Many people have their own limitations. Three
                                  characters in particular are restricted in
                                  their own unique way; Curley’s wife, Candy,
                                  and Crooks. With Curley’s wife she’s first
                                  described as having “full, rouged lips and
                                  wide-spaced eyes, heavily made up”(Steinbeck
                                  31) along with other descriptions about her
                                  appearance. There is nothing said about her
                                  character and even her name is unknown to the
                                  reader. This imagery of the only woman in the
                                  ranch is stereotypically pretty, hinting at
                                  the typical woman a man wants, with no regards
                                  to her personality. This objectification makes
                                  it so that a woman’s looks are her only power
                                  and, in the book, all they did was lead her to
                                  trouble. Candy’s trouble is his crippling age,
                                  and he’s disabled with only one hand. He
                                  obviously doesn’t have the strength of the
                                  other workers. This makes him weak and the
                                  ranch is a place where there is no place for
                                  the weak. When Candy is shown to “stare at the
                                  ceiling” (Steinbeck 49) he’s been deeply
                                  affected by the death of his dog. His dog was
                                  put to death because it was old and no longer
                                  had any usefulness. The dog symbolizes
                                  weakness. Its age makes it so that it can’t be
                                  compared to anything young. It’s blind, and
                                  thus it is constantly dependent on its owner.
                                  Weakness is also what isolates Curley’s wife.
                                  Being a woman, she is treated with
                                  condescension, it is not accepted for her to
                                  talk with anyone else besides Curley. If one
                                  can no longer serve a purpose, he or she will
                                  be removed, with no consideration to his or
                                  her situation. Nobody considers Crook’s
                                  situation either. He’s more secluded from the
                                  ranch workers than anybody else, since his
                                  race prevents him from interacting from
                                  everyone else. His crooked back is one of his
                                  weaknesses and he has “had more possessions
                                  than he could carry on his back” (Steinbeck
                                  67). His possessions are all he has that make
                                  him happy. His back is a symbol of oppression,
                                  and in this case, it stems from racism. He is
                                  constantly bent forward when facing white
                                  people since they rule over him. This
                                  oppression is what compelled Candy to allow
                                  his innocent dog to be put down. People are
                                  helpless against oppression because they have
                                  no chance of defending themselves, and their
                                  lack of choice is what causes their
                                  downfall&nbsp;</font></font></p>

                                  size="2" color="#330066"> Loneliness has been
                                  the biggest obstacle that has limited a
                                  person. Crooks isn’t the only one who is
                                  lonely. Everyone refuses to talk to Curley’s
                                  wife and without his dog Candy doesn’t have
                                  anyone. Loneliness was an effect of their
                                  constrictions. The characters attempted to
                                  overcome this loneliness by talking to Lennie.
                                  When Curley’s wife’s “words tumbled out in a
                                  passion of communication” (Steinbeck 88) she
                                  exemplified her desperation to talk to
                                  someone. The words are personified as tumbling
                                  because they escape her mouth suddenly, as it
                                  wasn’t supposed to happen. She’s isolated
                                  because she’s the only female in a ranch on
                                  men, but this proves how she’s actually just
                                  like everyone else. She’s also someone who
                                  couldn’t achieve her American dream. The
                                  characters were supposed to cure their
                                  loneliness because fate would interfere with
                                  their lives. Candy has been fate’s toy for
                                  years. Candy couldn’t achieve his longing for
                                  peace in in old life. He talked to Lennie so
                                  that he could stay at their ranch with them
                                  and live out his last days in peace. Otherwise
                                  he will suffer a worse fate, as he says “I
                                  wisht somebody'd shoot me. But they won't do
                                  nothing like that” (Steinbeck 60) if they ever
                                  let him go. A man is preferring death over
                                  spending more time at the ranch because most
                                  of the characters want a content life. Though,
                                  this better life can never be achieved,
                                  because fate won’t accept it. Crooks also
                                  wants peace. He’s accepted his social
                                  stereotype as an African American and seems to
                                  feel disdain when white people come near him.
                                  He ends up isolating himself even more, but he
                                  submits himself to “Lennie’s disarming smile”
                                  (Steinbeck 69). It’s ironic that he would be
                                  so welcoming towards Lennie when he has just
                                  told him to go away, meaning that he actually
                                  appreciates the company. Like many characters,
                                  he submits to Lennie’s smile because that’s
                                  the only way fill that empty void in his life.
                                  By interacting with those who are accepting of
                                  someone can that person’s unhappiness be
                                  relieved, but the world does not have many
                                  people who are this accepting.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

                                  size="2" color="#330066"> Even though there
                                  were attempt obstacles, that was never
                                  achievable. Crooks finally found someone to
                                  confide in, but that ended rapidly. He was
                                  pulled back to reality, where he realized he
                                  could never be with Lennie and George. When he
                                  “looked at the door” (Steinbeck 83) after
                                  Candy, George, and Lennie has left he was
                                  looking at a symbol of a boundary that he
                                  could never cross uninvited. The other
                                  characters were had more freedom because they
                                  were still thought of as people. Crooks is not
                                  a slave, but he is as much of a possession as
                                  his books. A limitation can make a man worth
                                  the same as an old dictionary. The dreams in
                                  this book are also worth this much. “Looked
                                  down at the hay” (Steinbeck 94) before letting
                                  George answer because he knew the truth. There
                                  was no way they were ever going to buy that
                                  ranch. That dream was a symbol of temptation.
                                  There wasn’t a character who achieved his
                                  American dream, because it’s unachievable.
                                  Yet, people constantly fall for its trap
                                  believing that their wishes can become a
                                  reality, but their disadvantages would keep
                                  their wishes from coming true. Curley’s wife
                                  wished to be in the movies but being a female,
                                  she was deceived into believing this. This
                                  forced her to marry Curley for financial
                                  reasons. The horses “rattled the halter
                                  chains” (Steinbeck 98) when she died because
                                  it foreshadowed the unavoidable danger. The
                                  loud rattling occurs whenever she was around,
                                  for it was a warning of what fate had in store
                                  for them. Fate is what decides one’s path in
                                  life, not one’s dreams.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

                                  attempts to overcome the obstacles that stem
                                  from their limitations, their endeavors are
                                  never authorized by fate. Jamal Penjweny is a
                                  photographer who showed many people in Iraq
                                  holding a picture of their favorite athlete.
                                  Each of these Iraqis were people with a dream,
                                  but due to poverty or physical injury they
                                  could not become the famous stars they though
                                  they were going to be. They didn't decide to
                                  be born poor or get life-changing injuries.
                                  Fate was the one who made disadvantaged. </font></font><font
