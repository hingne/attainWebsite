                          When the Iceberg Falls Apart <br>
                          <br>
                          If humans were given the choice between two stories,
                          which ones would be picked? In this instance, a story
                          isn’t something told before bedtime. A story is being
                          used as a perception of life. The definition of a good
                          story depends on person to person, but one novel
                          claims otherwise. Yann Martel’s novel Life of Pi is
                          about a young man, Pi Patel, and his family who are
                          immigrating to Canada via ship. A devastating
                          shipwreck Pi stranded at sea with various animals,
                          including a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. This
                          paper breaks down the novel using psychoanalysis.
                          Psychoanalytic criticism consists of the iceberg model
                          which consists of five elements; consciousness,
                          unconsciousness, id, superego, and ego. The id is a
                          human’s inner survival instincts and innate desires
                          which are suppressed in the unconsciousness. The
                          superego consists of one’s morality and values always
                          present in the consciousness. Lastly, the ego balances
                          the other two, and places parts of itself in both the
                          consciousness and unconsciousness. Life of Pi exposes
                          the interactions between the id, ego, and superego in
                          relation through the broader concept of storytelling,
                          to depict the compelling use of psychotherapy.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          As a response to the knowledge that one might die,
                          Pi’s id overrides his superego, and gradually his ego,
                          until the novel exposes the way the mind is unable to
                          control how information is processed and acted upon.
                          When Pi finally takes notice of the boat, he remarks
                          “It seemed orange - such nice Hindu color - is the
                          color of survival because the whole inside of the boat
                          and the tarpaulin and the life jackets and the
                          lifebuoy and the oars and most every other significant
                          object aboard was orange” (Martel 328). If orange is
                          meant to symbolize survival, then so would the orange
                          Richard Parker. In the case of Freudian psychology,
                          Richard Parker would be a representation of the id.
                          The tiger jumping from its hidden location in the boat
                          and taking control parallels the id being unleashed
                          from the unconsciousness. Pi would then be a symbol
                          for the superego, since both their lack of action
                          emphasizes the power of the id and how it will do
                          whatever it takes to survive. The superego will resist
                          but it will soon accept its circumstances. Thus, the
                          irony when Pi says “It was Richard Parker who calmed
                          me down. It is the irony of this story that the one
                          who scared me witless to start with was the very same
                          one who brought me peace, purpose, I dare say even
                          wholeness” (Martel 378) makes perfect sense. Despite
                          being conflicting in nature, the id and superego are
                          part of the same iceberg and at a certain point, such
                          as imminent death, the superego will allow the id to
                          do what it must accomplish in order to survive. As a
                          result, Richard Parker begins to release prusten
                          around Pi. “Prusten is the quietest of tiger calls, a
                          puff through the nose to express friendliness and
                          harmless intentions” (Martel 380). Prusten is a sense
                          of understanding between the id and superego, which
                          the superego will later use. The same should not be
                          said for the ego. With the id tipping the power
                          dynamic of the iceberg, the ego is not maintaining
                          balance. It will resist the id from taking over. The
                          various tests that Pi attempts to tame Richard Parker
                          are similar to the various tests the ego will do in an
                          attempt to tame the id. The tone shift in the chapter
                          is critical in understanding the personalities of the
                          id and superego. The beginning is quite serious, like
                          the id, while the later taming sequences are more
                          humorous. We see shifts in the tone from the previous
                          quote about Richard Parker calming Pi down to quotes
                          like “Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, without
                          further ado, it is my pleasure and honour to present
                          to you: THE PI PATEL, INDO-CANADIAN, TRANSPACIFIC,
                          FLOATING, CIRCUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!
                          TREEEEEE! TREEEEEE! TREEEEEE! TREEEEEE! C! TREEEEEE!”
                          (Martel 383-384). Despite this Pi’s final plane is
                          “Plan Number Seven: Keep Him Alive” (Martel 384)
                          proving how the superego will accept the reality of
                          the situation.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Although the id took power from the superego at first,
                          Pi’s superego slowly starts to act more like his id in
                          the consciousness so that the id is no longer needed,
                          and this allows the superego to remain morally good
                          but still survive. Soon Pi began to think about his
                          predicament and realized “There was not a shadow of
                          doubt about the matter: to leave the lifeboat meant
                          certain death. But what was staying aboard?” (Martel
                          346), with the lifeboat being his own id. With the id
                          in control, the superego is unable to perform its
                          functions of keeping its morals intact. When Pi breaks
                          down after killing his first sentient being, and
                          claims that he is “as guilty as Cain” (Martel 421),
                          his mind begins to realize that having the id in
                          control would kill Pi, even if he needs it. Luckily
                          Avinash de Sousa explains why the superego
                          relationship with the id is so special. “Freud gave
                          consciousness the quality and capacity to transform
                          experienced activity into unconscious states, similar
                          to how different forms of energy are interchanged in
                          physics. It could also play a part in inhibiting and
                          restricting certain thoughts from becoming conscious.
                          It also served the purpose of transforming quantities
                          of unconscious excitation into qualitative experiences
                          of pleasure and unpleasure” (de Sousa). This could
                          also mean that for select occasions the superego could
                          begin acting like the id. This would not mean that the
                          superego would turn into the id, but rather it would
                          perform the duties of both. Toward the end of the
                          novel, Pi takes notice of how the color of the boat
                          changes and says, “What was orange became whitish
                          orange” (Martel 552). White is meant to be the color
                          of purity, an aspect that the superego always fights
                          to keep intact. Though the orange still remains. This
                          is meant to explain two things. The first is that the
                          id is still very much present in the consciousness,
                          but it is more dormant. The second is the fact that
                          the superego is now beginning to adapt to the id’s
                          traits and will begin to perform its duties as well.
                          That is why there is an evidently stark contrast
                          between the tone when Pi kills his first fish and when
                          Pi kills the turtle in the latter part of the book.
                          There he makes points such as “Green sea turtles gave
                          more meat than hawksbills, and their belly shells were
                          thinner. But they tended to be bigger than hawksbills,
                          often too big to lift out of the water for the
                          weakened castaway that I became” (Martel 449). The
                          tone went from gloomy to almost technical. Despite
                          Pi’s strong values which he still holds, he has
                          descended so far down that the idea of eating the
                          animals has risen from his unconsciousness to the
                          point where it has become second nature. These
                          instincts exist inside each human in order to help us
                          survive, but in actuality, humans repress these
                          instincts because normally we don’t need them. For
                          some people like Pi, the superego is too powerful. If
                          the id were to ever come into full power, it could
                          completely destroy the mind.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Due to the imbalance between the id and the superego,
                          Pi’s ego is unable to complete its duty of balancing
                          his impulses in regards to understanding the mind’s
                          needs in relation to the situation, further depicting
                          the consequences of having a static ego. At the
                          beginning of the story, it is probably accurate to say
                          that Pi’s superego is the most dominant personality.
                          When this happens, the person is far too moralistic,
                          and would always turn himself or herself away from
                          anything he or she deems wrong. In this story that did
                          not matter, because Pi’s ego was able to keep his
                          superego in check. However, Martel creates the story
                          so that over time, we get a sense that Pi is becoming
                          weaker. This is because his ego no longer has any
                          grasp over Pi’s impulses. The id, and later the
                          superego which begins acting like the id, come into
                          power, and this makes Pi wilder. The ego is still part
                          of this iceberg, thus is still aware of what is
                          happening, and this is destroying Pi. Kendra Cherry
                          explains that if the ego was in control “An individual
                          with this type of personality might be so tied to
                          reality, rules, and appropriateness that they are
                          unable to engage in any type of spontaneous or
                          unexpected behavior. This individual may seem very
                          concrete and rigid, incapable of accepting change and
                          lacking an internal sense of right from wrong”
                          (Cherry). Too much of the ego is clearly the bad
                          thing, but now it is necessary to consider what would
                          happen if the ego wasn’t there. There would be too
                          many spontaneous decisions, and there would be no
                          regard to the outcomes of those decisions or any clear
                          reasoning that would help to deal with those outcomes.
                          If the individual was too concrete, they would unable
                          to process their situations. The reason why most
                          humans do not have to face this problem is that their
                          ego was always there to complete these tasks. It would
                          be disastrous for the ego to remain static. When Pi is
                          talking to the Japanese inspectors at the end of the
                          novel, he exclaims in an outburst “I applied reason at
                          every moment. The reason is excellent for getting
                          food, clothing, and shelter. The reason is the very
                          best tool kit. Nothing beats reason for keeping tigers
                          away. But be excessively reasonable and you risk
                          throwing out the universe with the bathwater” (Martel
                          672). Pi isn’t actually trying to talk to the
                          inspectors, but rather to his own ego and try to
                          console it. The comedy at the scene with the Japanese
                          inspectors is one of the most important moments of the
                          film. Pi obsessing over their food is how he is able
                          to control himself. Now that he has a constant supply
                          of food Pi is reminding his ego that his instincts are
                          no longer needed. Thus hiding all of the cookies under
                          the bedsheets are symbolic of repressing instincts
                          into the unconsciousness once again. Pi is begging the
                          ego to take control once again because the ego is the
                          part of our mind that allows us to move forward in
                          life.

                          Pi’s mind utilized imagination to create a story that
                          can protect its ego from the aftermath of what the id
                          and ego must do in order to survive, in an attempt to
                          establish the essentiality of storytelling. Rebecca
                          Duncan said, “Beyond lending credibility in a
                          traditional sense, Pi’s narrative strategies
                          illustrate the potential of the concept of
                          Nachtraglichkeit to investigate the fluid identity and
                          perceptions of the postmodern survivor” (Duncan 272).
                          Most humans stacks layers of information on each
                          other, and they are unable to get a clear perception
                          of their world. Martel uses religious motifs to
                          explain how Pi is different from other people. Early
                          on Pi takes notice of the area surrounding the town he
                          is in, and says “The hill on the right, across the
                          river from the hotel, had a Hindu temple high on its
                          side; the hill in the middle, further away, held up a
                          mosque, while the hill on the left was crowned with a
                          Christian church” (Martel 136). The idea of Pi
                          following three religions, or three different stories,
                          was used to explain that Pi has the ability to lay
                          stacks of information side by side. This way he has
                          the ability to view different perceptions of life at
                          the same time. As a result, Pi owns a strong
                          imagination, which he uses to create his own story. He
                          chooses to create the fictional story with all the
                          animals, which the audience learns at the end is
                          perfectly parallel to the second story he tells the
                          Japanese inspectors. Pi even says “the agnostic, if he
                          stays true to his reasonable self, if he stays
                          beholden to dry, yeastless faculty, might try to
                          explain the warm light bathing him by saying,
                          ‘Possibly a f-f-failing oxygenation of the b-b-brain,’
                          and, to the very end lack imagination and miss the
                          better story” (Martel 164) which is meant to explain
                          the dangers of believing in no story. Not only will
                          the yeastless version waste everybody’s time, it does
                          not have the capacity to give someone their sense of
                          life. Greg Wilson claims “In many ways, Yann Martel’s
                          Life of Pi is a blend of two seemingly contradictory
                          metafictional breeds, both of which ultimately address
                          the notions of truth and reality in storytelling”
                          (Wilson 201). Martel is claiming that Pi has the
                          greatest possible human mind. Through whichever angle
                          or lens Pi wishes to perceive life, his mind can do it
                          because it can balance the perfect picture of reality
                          and fiction. Pi recalls a moment with his professors
                          and a zebra where “Mr. Kumar said, ‘Equus burchelli
                          boehmi.’ Mr. Kumar said, ‘Allahu akbar.’ I said, ‘It’s
                          very pretty’” (Martel 146). Like most of the people
                          around Pi, society normally typically forces everyone
                          to view it through a single lens, believing it is not
                          normal to place different kinds of information side by
                          side. Life of Pi proves that each human has the
                          ability to see through multiple angles and follow each
                          one side by side, without consequences.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          In choosing to believe in the other story, the Pi’s
                          mind is able to undergo psychotherapy which allows the
                          id, ego, and superego to return to the usual states.
                          Rebecca Duncan states “Through fictional strategies,
                          Martel engages with, yet radically reshapes, the
                          survivor narrative, using metafictional and self
                          reflexive dimensions to suggest that a survivor must
                          not only survive the crisis but also come to terms
                          with the consequences of having survived” (Duncan
                          268). This ends up creating one of the significant
                          moments of the novel; Pi’s question of “‘So tell me,
                          since it makes no factual difference to you and you
                          can’t answer the question either way, which story do
                          you prefer?’” (Martel 706). Pi still isn’t really
                          speaking to the officers, but himself. Pi’s ego now
                          has now been given choice. The counterpart to the
                          story with the animals is the utterly terrifying story
                          with the humans. That version is the true story, and
                          no ego can disregard the reality. However, the story
                          with the animals is fake but greatly overlaps with the
                          true story. The fictional story can protect Pi for the
                          rest of his life, if his ego chooses that version.
                          Elizabeth Palmberg concludes “By the end, Pi’s belief
                          in God and love has been honed down to a stark,
                          unhopeful, desperate need for God and love - or for
                          storytelling, which Martel seems to regard as the same
                          thing” (Palmberg 206). The novel was framed with the
                          idea that Pi would be retelling his stories to an
                          author, who has been widely speculated to be based on
                          Yann Martel himself. Spreading the strength of
                          storytelling was Martel’s main goal throughout the
                          novel. For any person, the trauma is told through a
                          story in order to begin the psychotherapy that will
                          calm the ego down. This psychotherapy is a choice. One
                          choice can shred someone to pieces, and the other can
                          allow people to pick themselves up once more. All this
                          power is held through a choice of two stories. It is a
                          concept that is used universally, can be implemented
                          in ways that even save lives.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Life of Pi tells a story about stories as a Freudian
                          work of the id, ego, and superego in psychotherapy. In
                          a life-threatening moment, the relationship of the id,
                          ego, and superego can save and destroy someone.
                          Stories are the cure that can bring that person back.
                          They are so simple, yet Life of Pi uses their
                          simplicity to its advantage. Martel advocates that
                          there’s nothing more powerful than a story. Stories
                          guide people and take them on journeys of emotions.
                          They can also be the most potent defense mechanism.
                          Whichever story that one picks to define their life
                          will expose them to many dangers, and protect them
                          from many evils as well.
